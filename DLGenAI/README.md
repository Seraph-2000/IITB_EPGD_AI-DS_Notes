## 🧠 Deep Learning & Generative AI (DL & GenAI)

The `DL_GenAI/` folder contains my notes from **Semester 2** of the Executive PG Diploma in AI & DS at IIT Bombay.  
These notes cover foundational deep learning, modern architectures, transformers, generative models, retrieval-augmented systems, and agentic workflows.
